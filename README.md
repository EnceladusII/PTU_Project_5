Exploration of new approaches to define and evaluate a family of repeated regions through alignment using UniProt annotation and AlphaFold predictions

WD repeats form one of the largest folding families found in humans, with over 2,000 instances spread across 300 different proteins. These repeated regions associate to form a three-dimensional globular structure known as a beta-propeller, consisting of 4 to 8 blades, depending on the repeat families.
These repeats are difficult to characterize and classify due to their significant sequence variability. This complexity leads to numerous annotation errors, as observed in the UniProt database.
Where Project 3 aims to redefine the boundaries of beta-propeller domains formed by WD repeats to attempt to redefine the limits of these repeats, this project proposes a complementary approach, directly using the repeats as study objects. The focus will be primarily on sequence and structural alignment of repeats as annotated in UniProt. This will allow for the identification of critical parameters within the WD family, filtering and grouping them into subgroups if necessary. This information will be used to assess the quality of the currently available annotation on UniProt.
The ultimate goal is to propose several different definitions of WD repeats and to find objective criteria to assess the validity of each.

In the context of this project, you will:
   • Query the UniProt database to retrieve WD repeat annotations
   • Align, filter, and group the repeat sequences, then identify critical residues
   • Retrieve the predicted structures from AlphaFold (and/or PDB structures) of the repeats, superimpose, filter, and group them
   • Identify critical residues in the structure and compare them with the results obtained from sequence alignments
   • Compare your results/conclusions to existing annotations and try to identify cases where the annotation is most likely to be incorrect
   • Based on conclusions from the two previous approaches, identify different ways to define WD repeats within a beta-propeller and find ways to quantify the relevance of each method (it may be possible to collaborate with the Project 3 group to explore other avenues)
